# Tutorial: Using PLUMED Software for Protein-Ligand Unbinding Free Energy Calculation with Adaptive Gaussian Kernels

## Step 1: Set up the system
Start by preparing your system for molecular dynamics simulations. This involves obtaining the protein-ligand complex structure and solvating it in a suitable water box. Additionally, you may need to add ions to neutralize the system and set the desired ionic strength.

## Step 2: Install PLUMED
If you haven't installed PLUMED yet, you can follow the installation instructions provided on the official PLUMED website [here](https://www.plumed.org/). Make sure you have a compatible version of PLUMED installed that is compatible with your molecular dynamics simulation software.

## Step 3: Define the collective variables (CVs)
CVs are the variables that you want to bias during the metadynamics simulation. In this case, we want to bias the protein-ligand distance. Create a PLUMED input file (e.g., `plumed.dat`) and define the CVs using the `DISTANCE` keyword. Here's an example:

```
UNITS NATURAL
MOLINFO STRUCTURE=reference.pdb
WHOLEMOLECULES
g1: GROUP ATOMS=<atom-selection> (protein)
g2: GROUP ATOMS=<atom-selection>  (ligand)
c1: CENTER ATOMS=g1
c2: CENTER ATOMS=g2
cv1: DISTANCE ATOMS=c1,c2
```

Replace `<atom-selection>` with the appropriate atom selection for the protein-ligand distance. Usually the collective variable is the distance between the center of mass of the binding cavity of 
the protein and the center of mass of the ligand molecules. Here in this example , c1 and c2 are the center of mass atoms of protein and ligand respectively. cv1 is the collective varibale , which
is the distance between the c1 and c2.

## Step 4: Set up the metadynamics simulation
In the same `plumed.dat` file, define the metadynamics settings. We will use adaptive Gaussian kernels to bias the CVs. Here's an example:

```
restraint: METAD 
ARG=cv1 
SIGMA=500 # Initial Gaussian width ( based on adaptive gaussian kerenals using diffusion scheme with gaussian that should cover the space of 500 time steps in collective variables)
HEIGHT=0.30 # Gaussian height
PACE=500 # Frequency of Gaussian deposition
ADAPTIVE=DIFF # adaptive gaussian kernal with diffusion scheme (more about adpative gaussain kernals can be found in https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/ct3002464) 
GRID_MIN=0.0
GRID_MAX=1.5
GRID_BIN=1500
PRINT ARG=cv1  STRIDE=100 FILE=COLVAR 

```

Adjust the parameters according to your system. `SIGMA` controls the initial Gaussian width, `PACE` determines the frequency of Gaussian deposition, `HEIGHT` sets the Gaussian height, and `GRID_MIN`, `GRID_MAX`, and `GRID_BIN` define the grid for the free energy calculation.

## Step 5: Run the metadynamics simulation
Launch your molecular dynamics simulation using your preferred simulation software, making sure to pass the `plumed.dat` file as an input. For example, if you are using GROMACS, you can use the `-plumed plumed.dat` command-line option.

## Step 6: Analyze the results
After the simulation has finished, you can analyze the results using PLUMED. Run the following command:

```
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_pdb trajectory.pdb --mf_xtc trajectory.xtc --kt <temperature>
```

Replace `trajectory.pdb` and `trajectory.xtc` with the appropriate trajectory files generated by your simulation. `<temperature>` should be replaced with the temperature of your simulation in Kelvin.

## Step 7: Calculate the free energy profile
To obtain the protein-ligand unbinding free energy profile, you can use the `sum_hills` command in PLUMED. Run the following command:

```
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS
```

This will generate the file `fes.dat`, which contains the free energy profile as a function of the protein-ligand distance.

## Step 8: Extract the free energy of unbinding
From the free energy profile, you can extract the free energy of unbinding by locating the minimum of the profile. This corresponds to the unbound state of the system.
