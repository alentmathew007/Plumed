Tutorial: Using PLUMED Software for Protein-Ligand Unbinding Free Energy Calculation with Adaptive Gaussian Kernels
Step 1: Set up the system
Start by preparing your system for molecular dynamics simulations. This involves obtaining the protein-ligand complex structure and solvating it in a suitable water box. Additionally, you may need to add ions to neutralize the system and set the desired ionic strength.

Step 2: Install PLUMED
If you haven't installed PLUMED yet, you can follow the installation instructions provided on the official PLUMED website (https://www.plumed.org/). Make sure you have a compatible version of PLUMED installed that is compatible with your molecular dynamics simulation software.

Step 3: Define the collective variables (CVs)
CVs are the variables that you want to bias during the metadynamics simulation. In this case, we want to bias the protein-ligand distance. Create a PLUMED input file (e.g., plumed.dat) and define the CVs using the DISTANCE keyword. Here's an example:

css
Copy code
UNITS NATURAL
DISTANCE LABEL=distances ATOMS=<atom-selection>
Replace <atom-selection> with the appropriate atom selection for the protein-ligand distance.

Step 4: Set up the metadynamics simulation
In the same plumed.dat file, define the metadynamics settings. We will use adaptive Gaussian kernels to bias the CVs. Here's an example:

makefile
Copy code
METAD ...
ARG=distances
SIGMA=0.1   # Initial Gaussian width
PACE=500    # Frequency of Gaussian deposition
HEIGHT=0.5  # Gaussian height
GRID_MIN=0.0
GRID_MAX=1.5
GRID_BIN=1500
...
Adjust the parameters according to your system. SIGMA controls the initial Gaussian width, PACE determines the frequency of Gaussian deposition, HEIGHT sets the Gaussian height, and GRID_MIN, GRID_MAX, and GRID_BIN define the grid for the free energy calculation.

Step 5: Run the metadynamics simulation
Launch your molecular dynamics simulation using your preferred simulation software, making sure to pass the plumed.dat file as an input. For example, if you are using GROMACS, you can use the -plumed plumed.dat command-line option.

Step 6: Analyze the results
After the simulation has finished, you can analyze the results using PLUMED. Run the following command:

css
Copy code
plumed driver --plumed plumed.dat --mf_pdb trajectory.pdb --mf_xtc trajectory.xtc --kt <temperature>
Replace trajectory.pdb and trajectory.xtc with the appropriate trajectory files generated by your simulation. <temperature> should be replaced with the temperature of your simulation in Kelvin.

Step 7: Calculate the free energy profile
To obtain the protein-ligand unbinding free energy profile, you can use the sum_hills command in PLUMED. Run the following command:

css
Copy code
plumed sum_hills --hills HILLS
This will generate the file fes.dat, which contains the free energy profile as a function of the protein-ligand distance.

Step 8: Extract the free energy of unbinding
From the free energy profile, you can extract the free energy of unbinding by locating the minimum of the profile. This corresponds to the unbound state of the system.
